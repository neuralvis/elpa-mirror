Time management tool for today's tasks showing them with estimated
start/end time.

Make a list of tasks for today and show the list with todo state,
estimated start and end time of task.  You can see what task you're
working on, what tasks you've done today with time log and rest
tasks for today with estimated start and end time.  And you can
also manipulate tasks in the list like org-agenda.

This package uses org-id to find an org heading.  So ID property
of an org heading is set as needed.

* About TaskChute

TaskChute (https://taskchute.net/) is a method and tools to manage
tasks and time.

I'm interested in TaskChute and I had wanted to do that, but it was
difficult for me to move to other task management tools because I
had already had many tasks in org-mode.  So I had started to
develop this package to do TaskChute in Emacs with org-mode.
However I haven't used the original TaskChute, so this package may
be a TaskChute like tool but it doesn't represent TaskChute's
features and its philosophy completely.
