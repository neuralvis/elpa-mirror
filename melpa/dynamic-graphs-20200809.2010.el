;;; Commentary:

;; Make dynamic graphs: take a graph (as defined for graphviz), apply
;; some filters, and display it as an image.  The graph can be either
;; a function that inserts the graph (and is called for each
;; redisplay), or a buffer that can change.  An imap file is created
;; in addition to the image so that clicks on image can be related to
;; individual nodes (TODO: only for rectangles so far)
;;
;; The filters can apply both enhancing operations (add colors, ...)
;; and more complicated operations coded in gvpr.  As a special case
;; there is a filter that removes all nodes that are more distant than
;; a parameter from a root node.
;;
;; The image is displayed with a specialized minor mode.
;; Predefined key bindings on the displayed image in this mode include:
;; - e (dynamic-graphs-set-engine) change grahviz engine (dot, circo, ...)
;; - c (dynamic-graphs-remove-cycles) change whether cycles are removed
;; - 1-9 (dynamic-graphs-zoom-by-key) set maximum displayed distance from a root node
;; - mouse-1 (dynamic-graphs-handle-click) follow link defined in imap
;;   file - that is, in URL attribute of the node.  Link is followed
;;   by customizable function, by default `browse-url' - but
;;   `org-link-open-from-string' might be more useful.
;; - S-mouse-1 (dynamic-graphs-shift-focus) if the link for node is
;;   id:<node name>, extract node name and make it a new
;;   root.  Predefined filter `node-refs' set hrefs in such way.  This
;;   simplifies things when nodes relate to org mode items, but
;;   actually does not make much sense otherwise.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;; (dynamic-graphs-display-graph "test" nil
;;		   (lambda ()
;;		     (insert "digraph Gr {A->B B->C C->A A->E->F->G}"))
;;		   '(2 remove-cycles "N {style=\"filled\",fillcolor=\"lightgreen\"}"
;;                   node-refs boxize))
