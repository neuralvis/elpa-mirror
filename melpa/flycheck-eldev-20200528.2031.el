;;; Commentary:

;; Add Eldev support to Flycheck.
;;
;; For a project to be detected, it must contain file `Eldev' or
;; `Eldev-local' in its root directory, even if Eldev doesn’t strictly
;; require that.
;;
;; Features:
;;
;; * No additional steps to be performed from the command line, not
;;   even `eldev prepare'.
;;
;; * Project dependencies are seen by Flycheck in Emacs.  Similarly,
;;   if a package is not declared as a dependency of your project,
;;   Flycheck will complain about unimportable features or undeclared
;;   functions.
;;
;; * Everything is done on-the-fly.  As you edit your project’s
;;   dependency list in its main `.el' file, added, removed or
;;   mistyped dependency names immediately become available to
;;   Flycheck (there might be some delays due to network, as Eldev
;;   needs to fetch them first).
;;
;; * Additional test dependencies (see `eldev-add-extra-dependencies')
;;   are seen from the test files, but not from the main files.
;;
;; For the extension to have any effect, you need to install Eldev:
;;
;;     https://github.com/doublep/eldev#installation
;;
;; If Flycheck doesn’t seem to recognize dependencies declared in a
;; project, verify its setup (`C-c !  v').
