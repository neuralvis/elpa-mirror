;;; Commentary:

;; `ink-mode' provides syntax highlighting and indentation for
;; the Ink scripting language, developed by Inkle Studios.

;; Other features are: divert autocompletion and links to headers and
;; labels; an `ink-play' command to playtest your story from Emacs
;; (bound to C-c C-c by default); an outline similar to org-mode's;
;; error reporting using flycheck; a collection of YASnippet snippets.
