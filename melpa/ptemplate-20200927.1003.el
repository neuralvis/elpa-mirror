;;; Commentary:
;; Creating projects can be a lot of work. Cask files need to be set up, a
;; License file must be added, maybe build system files need to be created. A
;; lot of that can be automated, which is what ptemplate does. You can create a
;; set of templates categorized by type/template like in eclipse, and ptemplate
;; will then initialize the project for you. In the template you can have any
;; number of yasnippets or normal files.

;; Security note: yasnippets allow arbitrary code execution, as do .ptemplate.el
;; files. DO NOT EXPAND UNTRUSTED PTEMPLATES. Ptemplate DOES NOT make ANY
;; special effort to protect against malicious templates.

(require 'subr-x)

(defvar-local ptemplate--snippet-chain nil
  "Cons pointer to list of (SNIPPET . TARGET) or BUFFER.
Template directories can have any number of yasnippet files.
These need to be filled in by the user. To do this, there is a
snippet chain: a list of snippets and their target files or
buffers. During expansion of a template directory, first all
snippets are gathered into a list, the first snippet of which is
then shown to the user. If the user presses
\\<ptemplate-snippet-chain-mode-map>
\\[ptemplate-snippet-chain-next], the next item in the snippet
chain is displayed. Buffers are appended to this list when the
user presses \\<ptemplate-snippet-chain-mode-map>
\\[ptemplate-snippet-chain-later].

To facilitate the expansion of multiple templates at once, the
snippet chain must be buffer-local. However, if each buffer has
its own list, updates to it wouldn't be synced across buffers
stored for later finalization. Such buffers would contain already
finalized filenames in their snippet chain. Because of this, a
solution needs to be devised to share a buffer local value
between multiple buffers, and `ptemplate--snippet-chain' works as
follows: This variable actually stores a cons, the `cdr' of which
points to the actual snippet chain, as described above, the `car'
always being ignored. This way \(`pop' (`cdr'
`ptemplate--snippet-chain')\) modifies it in a way that is shared
between all buffers.

See also `ptemplate--snippet-chain-start'.")

are:

      section is specified.

:before-snippets FORMs to run before expanding yasnippets.

:after-copy FORMs to run after all files have been copied. The
            ptemplate's snippets need not have been expanded
            already.

:finalize FORMs to run after expansion finishes.

:snippet-env VARIABLES to make available in snippets. Their
             values are examined at the end of `ptemplate!' and
             stored. Each element after :env shall be a symbol or
             a list of the form (SYMBOL VALUEFORM), like in

             let-bound outside of `ptemplate!' and used in
             snippets. Leaving out VALUEFORM makes it nil.

:snippet-let VARIABLES to `let*'-bind around the `ptemplate!'
             block and to include in the snippet environment.
             Each ARG shall be a list (SYMBOL VALUEFORM) or just
             SYMBOL. If specified as SYMBOL, the variable is
             initialized to nil. Otherwise, VALUEFORM is used to
             initialize the variable. Note that the value of
             snippet-let blocks can be changed in :init.

:ignore See `ptemplate-ignore'. Files are pruned before
        :init.

:subdir Make some template-relative paths appear to be in the
        root. Practically, this means not adding its files and
        including it. Evaluated before :init.

:remap ARG shall be of the form \(SRC TARGET\); calls
       `ptemplate-remap' on the results of evaluating SRC and
       TARGET. Run after :init.

:remap-rec Like :remap, but call `ptemplate-remap-rec' instead.
           Note that it is undefined whether :remap-rec or :remap
           is executed firsts and their order of appearance is
           insignificant.

:map Syntax sugar for `ptemplate-map'. ARG must be of the form
     \(SRC TARGET\), both of which are ordinary LISP expressions.
     Run after :remap and :remap-rec.

:inherit Syntax sugar for `ptemplate-inherit'. FORMs may be
         arbitrary Lisp expressions \(not just strings\).
         Executed after :map.

:open-bg Expressions yielding files \(target-relative\) to open
         with `find-file-noselect' at the very end of expansion.

:open Like :open-bg, but using `find-file'.

Note that because .ptemplate.el files just execute arbitrary
code, you could write them entirely without using this
macro (e.g. by modifying hooks directly, ...). However, you
should still use `ptemplate!', as this makes templates more
future-proof and readable."
