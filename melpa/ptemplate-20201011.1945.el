;;; Commentary:
;; Creating projects can be a lot of work. Cask files need to be set up, a
;; License file must be added, maybe build system files need to be created. A
;; lot of that can be automated, which is what ptemplate does. You can create a
;; set of templates categorized by type/template like in eclipse, and ptemplate
;; will then initialize the project for you. In the template you can have any
;; number of yasnippets or normal files.

;; Security note: yasnippets allow arbitrary code execution, as do
;; .ptemplate.el files. DO NOT EXPAND UNTRUSTED TEMPLATES. ptemplate DOES NOT
;; make ANY special effort to protect against malicious templates.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'subr-x)                       ; `string-join'

;;; global `declare-function'

(defmacro ptemplate! (&rest args)
  "Define a smart ptemplate with elisp.
For use in .ptemplate.el files. ARGS is a plist-like list with
any number of sections, specified as :<section name>
FORM... (like in `use-package'). Sections can appear multiple
times: you could, for example, have multiple :init sections, the
FORMs of which would get evaluated in sequence. Supported keyword
are:

:init FORMs to run before expansion. This is the default when no
      section is specified.

:before-snippets FORMs to run before expanding yasnippets.

:after-copy FORMs to run after all files have been copied. The
            ptemplate's snippets need not have been expanded
            already.

:finalize FORMs to run after expansion finishes.

:snippet-env VARIABLES to make available in snippets. Their
             values are examined at the end of `ptemplate!' and
             stored. Each element after :env shall be a symbol or
             a list of the form (SYMBOL VALUEFORM), like in
             `let'. The SYMBOLs should not be quoted. If only a
             symbol is specified, its value is taken from the
             current environment. This way, variables can be
             let-bound outside of `ptemplate!' and used in
             snippets. Leaving out VALUEFORM makes it nil.

:snippet-let VARIABLES to `let*'-bind around the `ptemplate!'
             block and to include in the snippet environment.
             Each ARG shall be a list (SYMBOL VALUEFORM) or just
             SYMBOL. If specified as SYMBOL, the variable is
             initialized to nil. Otherwise, VALUEFORM is used to
             initialize the variable. Note that the value of
             snippet-let blocks can be changed in :init.

:ignore Syntax sugar for `ptemplate-ignore'. Files are pruned
        before :init.

:subdir Make some template-relative paths appear to be in the
        root. Practically, this means not adding its files and
        including it. Evaluated before :init.

:remap ARG shall be of the form \(SRC TARGET\); calls
       `ptemplate-remap' on the results of evaluating SRC and
       TARGET. Run after :init.

:remap-rec Like :remap, but call `ptemplate-remap-rec' instead.
           Note that it is undefined whether :remap-rec or :remap
           is executed firsts and their order of appearance is
           insignificant.

:map Syntax sugar for `ptemplate-map'. ARG must be of the form
     \(SRC TARGET\), both of which are ordinary LISP expressions.
     Run after :remap and :remap-rec.

:inherit Syntax sugar for `ptemplate-inherit'. FORMs may be
         arbitrary Lisp expressions \(not just strings\).
         Executed after :map.

:open-bg Expressions yielding files \(target-relative\) to open
         with `find-file-noselect' at the very end of expansion.

:open Like :open-bg, but open the last file using `find-file'.
      Files that are not the last one will be opened using
      `find-file-noselect'.

:late Executed after :inherit.

Note that because .ptemplate.el files just execute arbitrary
code, you could write them entirely without using this
macro (e.g. by modifying hooks directly, ...). However, you
should still use `ptemplate!', as it abstracts away those
internal details, which are subject to change at any time."
