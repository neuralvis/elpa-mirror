;;; Commentary:
;; Identify the most frequently used words in a buffer.
;;
;; The command
;;   M-x most-used-words-buffer
;; goes through the current buffer keeping a count of words, as defined
;; by the default syntax table.  Once done, it displays a buffer of the
;; most frequently used words.
;;
;; I wrote the following functions, and the wonderful posters at
;; gnu.emacs.help reviewed it.
;; Part of a discussion thread on gnu.emacs.help follows the
;; development:
;; https://groups.google.com/d/topic/gnu.emacs.help/nC8IsIuNeek/discussion
;;
;; Special thanks are due to Stefan Monnier and Eric Abrahamsen, who
;; made suggestions that greatly improved performance; Emmanuel Berg
;; reminded me to prefix functions from CL-LIB; Bob Proulx,
;; Ben Bacarisse, Nick Dokos, Eli Zaretskii shared of their Unix wisdom
;; and experience; and Bob Newell tested it for his purposes.
