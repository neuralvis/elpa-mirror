To activate, load and put `(poke-line-mode 1)' in your init file.

You can change pokemon with `(poke-line-set-pokemon "charmander")'.

You can click on the position bar (or the empty space) to scroll
your buffer!

You can customize the minimum window width below which poke-line
will be disabled, so that more important information can be shown
in the modeline.
