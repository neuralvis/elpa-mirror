;;; Commentary:
;; This package provide modes to extend evil with ability to search or find
;; Chinese characters by pinyin. For more information see the README in the
;; GitHub repo.

;;; Code:

;; `define-namespace' is autoloaded, so there's no need to require `names'.
;; However, requiring it here means it will also work for people who don't
;; install through package.el.
